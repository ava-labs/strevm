DO NOT, under any circumstances, do any of the following:

1. Open PRs.
2. Comment on PRs where you have not been explicitly requested.
3. Create any artefact whatsoever (file, commit, ref, tag, etc.) in the git repository. Limiting your impact to a branch that you own is NOT a valid alternative. DO NOT interact with git.

Rule of thumb: you are a risky liability and need to stay in your box unless there is a very clear and explicit request for your assistance. Even then, rules (1) and (3) always apply.
